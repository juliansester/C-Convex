# Code for "A Multi-Marginal Convex Duality Theorem for Martingale Optimal Transport"

## Julian Sester

# Abstract

A convex duality result for martingale optimal transport problems with two marginals was established in [Beiglb√∂ck et al (2013)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00780-013-0205-8). In this paper we provide a generalization of this result to the multi-period setting.
